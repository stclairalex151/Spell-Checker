# Spell-Checker

Welcome to the network based spell checker:

The purpose of this program is to run on a specified port and listen for incoming connections from users. When a user connects, the program will prompt them for a word to be spellchecked. Enter the word into the terminal and press enter. If you would like to quit, press the escape key and then enter. The program will check a dictionary to see if your word exists in the dictionary and returns the status to you.
